	Engine engine;

// there is a difference between constructor and setter: setter is a method which is used to update the object later on the line
// whereas constructor is used to create the object itself so usage of Autowired on a setter and constructor is little different

// THIRD VIDEO ONLY THIS :) QUALIFIER ANNOTATIONS

// if we make the engine class as interface and implements two classes from it named V8 & V6, then have to make both the classes as component
// and on calling @Autowired Engine engine it will show error., we can make Engine V8(or V6) and call using the same object.
// the better approach is use @Autowired @Qualifer("v6") Engine engine --- here qualifier removes the ambiguity os selection of implementation.
